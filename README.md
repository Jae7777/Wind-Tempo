# Wind-Tempo

## Overview
**Wind Tempo** is a rhythm-based piano game inspired by popular rhythm titles like *OSU!* and *Guitar Hero*.  
Instead of tapping circles or strumming guitars, players use a **MIDI keyboard** or a **digital keyboard** to hit falling notes in sync with the music.  

The goal of this project is to create a game that’s both **fun and educational**, helping players improve rhythm, timing, and piano skills.
