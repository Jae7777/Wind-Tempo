# Wind-Tempo

**Wind Tempo** is a rhythm-based piano game inspired by popular rhythm titles like *OSU!* and *Guitar Hero*.  
Instead of tapping circles or strumming guitars, players use a **MIDI/Digital Keyboard** to hit falling notes in sync with the music.  

The goal is to create a game that’s fun and educational, helping players improve rhythm, timing, and piano skills.
